Here’s the same tone — direct, grounded — but aligned with where you’re actually going.

# Hey, I'm Sadiel 👋

I build practical systems at the intersection of **cloud security, automation, AI, and decentralized tech** — tools that actually run, monitor, respond, and improve over time.

I’m not interested in theory projects. I build things that detect real issues, automate real workflows, and create real leverage.

Currently pursuing remote roles in **Cloud Security / DevSecOps / Security Operations**, while building long-term leverage through AI systems and automation-driven services.

## 🎯 Focus

I’m focused on the overlap between **security engineering, automation, and AI agents**.

* Automating detection and response
* Building infrastructure that secures itself
* Using AI as a force multiplier — not a crutch
* Turning repeatable processes into systems

Long term: location-independent, high-income technical work backed by real proof — projects, not just certifications.
